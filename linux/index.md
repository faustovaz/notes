# **Linux**

- **systemctl**

  - In general, services are located in `/etc/systemd/system/` and are described in `.services` files.
    To create a new service, follow the steps:

    1. Create a `.service` file, for example `my-app.service`

    2. Add context:

       ```bash
       [service]
       ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/code/app.py
       ```

    3. Reload systemctl daemon: `$ systemctl daemon-reload`

    4. Start the new service: `$ systemctl start my-app`

    5. To start a service when the system is booted up:

       ```bash
       [unit]
       Description=My python web app
       
       [service]
       ExecStart=<command>
       ExecStartPre=<command>
       ExecStartPos=<command>
       
       [install]
       WantedBy=multi-user.target
       ```
